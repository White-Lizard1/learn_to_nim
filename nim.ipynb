    "Nim is a simple board game played between two people, invented in China some time before 1500. In 1902, a mathematician named Charles L. Bouton published a 5-page paper describing and solving Nim. Later mathematicians Roland Sprague and Patrick M. Grundy independently discovered an important theorem in the 1930s that uses Nim, as we will see, to say unexpected things about many other games.\n",

    "There are generally four steps to finding a strategy for a game. Firstly, you should **play around and familiarize yourself with the game**. You have already done this by playing against the bot, and feel free to go back at any time to play it again by selecting the play_babybot() cell and hitting \"Run\" again. The point of this is to build an intuition around how the game works, and what some potential strategies are. Even if you lose, observing how you lost can teach you a lot.\n",

Later, we will use more efficient methods, but for now a brute force approach is the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thirdly, you **try to solve more complex cases**, working upwards by solving slightly more difficult positions each time. As you do this, you will build up **\"heuristics\"**, ways of quickly evaluating a position as a win or a loss without having to calculate every option. Using these heuristics, supplemented by a bit of brute force calculation, the internal beauty of the game will tend to reveal itself to you in little lightbulb moments as you explore its depths.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, you will **generalize your heuristics** to find a complete strategy for the game. Patterns previously undetected will pop out at you, and you will expose the underlying mathematical structure of the game as if it came straight out of The Book.\n",

    "Just as often, though, the truth will elude you, and you will find yourself banging your head against the wall with no clear way forward. Sometimes the solution is inelegant and seems arbitrary.

    "The very simplest case is when there are no heaps at all—the end of the game. This position, by our rules, is a loss for the first player (who cannot move), and thus a win the second player. There is little else to say, so we will move on.\n",

Likewise the one-heap one-stone position from above is called an N-position because the \"n\"ext player to move wins—by removing the one stone.\n",

Games like this are called **partisan** games, and cannot be described using P- or N-positions.\n",

    "\n",
    "By this we conclude that any one-heap position is a win for the next player to play—the strategy is simply to remove the entire heap, and your opponent will lose on the next move.\n",

    "To recap:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Nim is an **impartial** game (both players have access to the same moves)\n",

I will test you on that in a minute, but I should talk a bit more about P- and N-positions before that.\n",

One way to find this is using the Tweedledum and Tweedledee argument: separating the position into two groups of (1,2), and whatever your opponent does to one group, you do to the other. You could also get to this faster by realizing that adding a pair of the same numbers to a position does nothing to it, so the strategy for (1,1,2,2,3) is the same as the strategy for (1,1,3), which is the same as the strategy for 3: Remove the pile of 3.

    "The first thing we have to do is check that the position is, indeed, an N-position. It turns out that the nim-sum of those four numbers is 125, which isn't 0, so it is an N-position. But how do we turn our nim-sum into a strategy? Well, remember that if we know that 20 + 31 + 37 + 83 = 125, we know that 20 + 31 + 37 + 83 + 125 is 0. We have to do something to the position (20,31,37,83) that makes it into a P-position. We wish we could add another heap of 125 to it, because that would make it 0, but that is against the rules (and besides, our opponent would remove the new heap, bringing us to the same position again). \n",

Because we can make a heap smaller, making the heap smaller in a certain way will correspond to \"removing\" a heap of 125. So we check, for each heap, whether 125 + that heap = a smaller heap.\n",
