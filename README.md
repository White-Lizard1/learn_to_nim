The simplest way to access is through Binder, which allows to you interact with the file in a brower, no setup needed. Downside: website is slow and sometimes it completely fails to work. Good luck. https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/White-Lizard1/learn_to_nim/main?labpath=nim.ipynb

My preferred way: download the file nim.ipnyb (**i**nteractive **py**thon **n**ote**b**ook), [download](https://jupyter.org/install) Jupyter notebook
